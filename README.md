#### 👋 Hi there! I’m Darlysson Alves, a Frontend Developer currently working and living in the lovely city of Lisbon 🇵🇹. 

> I'm curious, enthusiastic and student most of the time. Passionate about learning new things, especially related to frontend development.

* 👀 I’m interested in JamStack (GatsbyJS & Next.js), CSS, ReactJS & Typescript.
* ⚙️ Some of the technologies I have been working with are `Outsystems`, `html`, `CSS (Sass)`, `Handlebars` ...
* ⚡️ Fun fact: I'm a big fan of sports, mainly Footbal ❤⚽
